1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,830

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,300
HAMILTON MORRIS: Dearest
Krystle, I cannot express the

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,300
excitement within me when I
think that shortly we will

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,720
meet face to face.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,920

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,490
Over the years, I've read your
books and watched your videos,

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,160
perused court documents,
police records, and

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,780
affidavits, yet I still feel
confused about what happened

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:33,460
between you, Todd, and the LSD
laboratory so many years ago.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,060
I hope that when we are
together, I will finally

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,710
understand what transpired,
and the truth will shine

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,690
brightly as a crystal
in the Kansas sky.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,690

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,145
Much love, Hamilton.

15
00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:57,480

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,610
Krystle Cole is one of the most
unlikely figures in the

17
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,320
psychedelic community.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,880
A Goth stripper from Kansas
whose introduction to the

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,570
psychedelic underground came in
February of 2000, when she

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,430
fell deeply in love with a
mysterious man named Todd, who

21
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,290
was the heir to a spring
manufacturing fortune.

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,520
She quit her job as a dancer
and moved in with Todd at a

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,490
decommissioned nuclear missile
silo that served as his

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,230
private pleasure of
lysergic delights.

25
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,020

26
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,980
Exactly what happened in that
laboratory at the dawn of the

27
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,800
new millennium is still a
subject of heated debate.

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,430
But it is known that Todd formed
a partnership with

29
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,200
Leonard Pickard, an accomplished
clandestine

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,810
psychedelic chemist.

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,660
And together they began to
assemble what would have been

32
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,460
the world's largest LSD lab.

33
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,480
But before the lab could be put
into full operation, it

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,780
was destroyed by the DEA.

35
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,940
After verifying that my
intentions were pure, Krystle

36
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,940
agreed to meet with me to
discuss her involvement in the

37
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,830
lab and take me on a guided tour
of the subterranean LSD

38
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,045
palace that she once
called home.

39
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:19,820

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,980
Last night we flew into Kansas
City, and right now we're on

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,180
our way to meet Krystle Cole.

42
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,780
Outside of what she's written in
her book, Lysergic, and her

43
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,600
numerous YouTube videos,
there's very

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,905
little known about her.

45
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:34,990
I have a lot of questions.

46
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,969
I've wanted to meet her
for a long time.

47
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:42,470

48
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,720
Here we are.

49
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,440

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Hey, what's going on?

51
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
It's Hamilton.

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,260
Nice to meet you.

53
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,590
KRYSTLE COLE: I was raised in a
small Kansas town, which is

54
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,770
comparable to being sucked into
a spiritual black hole.

55
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,040
I was surrounded by flat, bleak
cornfields farmed by

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,110
similarly flat, bleak people.

57
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,285
At a young age, my classmates
labeled me as a nerd, causing

58
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,990
me to never quite fit in.

59
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,640
The first thing that comes to
mind upon reflection is, thank

60
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,350
god for being an outcast.

61
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,180
My peers were the perfect
example of white

62
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,810
trash at its worst.

63
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,920
The majority of them had already
given birth to a

64
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,430
couple children and dropped
out of high

65
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,040
school because of it.

66
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,790
No aspirations existed in their
minds beyond the next

67
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,260
round of incestuous
sex, six-pack of

68
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,360
beer, and line of meth.

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,240
HAMILTON MORRIS: Krystle is
one of very few people

70
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,820
surrounding the bust who is not
currently incarcerated.

71
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,590
And in the wake of extraordinary
heartbreak,

72
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,590
trials, and prison sentences,
she used her life experience

73
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,130
to inspire a variety of
informational YouTube videos

74
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,850
that have garnered much
attention across the internet.

75
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,590
KRYSTLE COLE: So this is the
green screen that I use to

76
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,910
shoot all the NeuroSoup
videos.

77
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,360
So I came up with the name
NeuroSoup because it's

78
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,290
basically the combination of
neurology and then the soup,

79
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,710
we all have this soup of
different neurotransmitters in

80
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,390
our brains.

81
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,500
And so drugs affect these
neurotransmitters, and so

82
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,230
that's kind of how I came up
with the name NeuroSoup.

83
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,050
HAMILTON MORRIS: Mm.

84
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,670
You were saying that your most
popular YouTube video is the

85
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,070
Shamanic Colonic
anal DMT video.

86
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,420
-Hi.

87
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,140
Some people have gotten onto the
NeuroSoup forum and asked

88
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,820
me about the time that
I took DMT anally.

89
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,270
And so today I want to describe
that for you guys.

90
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,000
There are some benefits to it.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,470
I've only done it anally once,
because I guess the negative

92
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,800
side effect to it, while I'm
talking about all the

93
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,967
positives, is that it burned
really bad, and it just kind

94
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:36,030
of put me in this weird
head space.

95
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,440
KRYSTLE COLE: That was my most
popular one until YouTube

96
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,040
forced me to remove it because
of its new community content

97
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,550
guidelines.

98
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,332
There's some other paintings
and more

99
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,145
paintings and more fractals.

100
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:49,810
I kind of have them on
the walls everywhere.

101
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,180
And of course, Grateful
Dead bears.

102
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,080
That one is the one that I put
on my first edition of

103
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,690
Lysergic book cover.

104
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,400
It's my favorite one.

105
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,940
And the language around the side
of it are things that I

106
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,650
kind of saw when I was
tripping, these

107
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,500
alienesque-type languages.

108
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,492
I don't know what you
would call it.

109
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:08,830
HAMILTON MORRIS: Can you talk
about just the things you talk

110
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,590
about the beginning of Lysergic,
how you initially

111
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,470
got involved in all of this?

112
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,860
KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah, well, I
met Todd at a strip club.

113
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,010
I worked there for about
three months.

114
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,940
And he came in--

115
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,520
well, actually, one of
his employees came

116
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,720
in and saw me first.

117
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,090
And then they went back, and
they said, oh, there's this

118
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,250
girl down there you should
see, kind of thing.

119
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,710
So then he came and met me.

120
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,430
And shortly thereafter, I was
driving one of his Porsches

121
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,420
and living at his
missile site.

122
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,420
HAMILTON MORRIS: I asked Krystle
to take me on a tour

123
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,530
of the silo, which is now
owned by a vintage tank

124
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,240
enthusiast.

125
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,370
It will be the first time
Krystle has entered the silo

126
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,220
since her romance with Todd.

127
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,967
When Todd was seducing
you, what kinds of

128
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,210
things would he say?

129
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,506
KRYSTLE COLE: Oh, boy.

130
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:55,280
I don't know.

131
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,010
Um, at first he was
very gentlemanly.

132
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,490
It wasn't like he was drugging
me and taking

133
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,510
advantage or anything.

134
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,860
At first he was being the utmost
gentleman, to try to

135
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,150
win my trust over.

136
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,215
HAMILTON MORRIS: On the way,
we passed the place Krystle

137
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:11,460
and Todd first met--

138
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,960
Club Orleans, one of Topeka's
premier exotic dance

139
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,030
establishments.

140
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,800
KRYSTLE COLE: This was the club
that I met Todd, although

141
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,430
it was a different
name back then.

142
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,720
They've kind of remodeled
since then.

143
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,690
I did kind of an interesting
act.

144
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,170
I did a bondage act.

145
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,440
And so I--

146
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,550
really stood out for the Kansas
crowd that's in there.

147
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,120
I would play death metal music,
and I had this, like,

148
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,610
chain that I would hold around
my neck with a dog collar.

149
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,440
I'd wrap it around the pole
and stuff, and I'd

150
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,690
whip myself on stage.

151
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,260

152
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,570
I was really into
Goth back then.

153
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,830
Because I really hated Kansas,
and I was just rebelling

154
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,170
against everything that this
whole place was about.

155
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,460
And so he comes in there.

156
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,965
He was sort of like
the mad scientist.

157
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:55,920
If you can imagine, like, a guy
walking around with this

158
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,670
big metal briefcase,
you know, bald--

159
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,880
and his hair, like, what hair
is left sticking up

160
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,330
everywhere.

161
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,370
His clothes rattered,
tattered everywhere.

162
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,460
He would come in there and just
sit with me and pay me

163
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,020
like lots and lots of money just
to hang out in the VIP

164
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,520
room with him.

165
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,010
And he would sit there
for the whole day.

166
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,820
And we did that for
a couple of times.

167
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,410
And then he's like, well, why
don't you just come out to

168
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,180
where I live, and stuff?

169
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,350
And I was like, well, OK.

170
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,170
I'll go out to your
place with you.

171
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,016
They have a policy where you're
not supposed to leave

172
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:24,550
with customers.

173
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,600
You're not supposed
to do that.

174
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,270
And I never would have done
that, but Todd was so

175
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,152
persuasive.

176
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:33,100
And so, I kind of gave in.

177
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,220
I probably shouldn't have.

178
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,100
If I wouldn't have met him, I
wouldn't have had all this

179
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,400
horrible stuff happen.

180
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,820
But I also wouldn't have had
all the cool stuff happen.

181
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,290
He drove Porsches and
had lots of money.

182
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,030
And, you know, he bought me
Armani clothes and gave me

183
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,130
money, and I didn't
have to work at

184
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,100
the strip club anymore.

185
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,110
So I was like, hey,
let's party.

186
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,360
I didn't care.

187
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,680

188
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,460
I'm kind of excited to see what
it looks like in there.

189
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,540
I think it's going to bring
back a lot of memories.

190
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,760
HAMILTON MORRIS: As we drew
near the legendary missile

191
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,520
silo, I tried to imagine Krystle
arriving here with

192
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,530
Todd for the very first time.

193
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,540
KRYSTLE COLE: You used to have
to call in using this system

194
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,730
right there, or you'd
have an access code.

195
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,680
HAMILTON MORRIS: Upon entering
this silo, Krystle left the

196
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,860
spiritual black hole of Kansas
behind forever and was

197
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,970
introduced to Todd and Leonard's
underground ring of

198
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,850
chemists, dealers, and drug
enforcement agents.

199
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,560
KRYSTLE COLE: These tunnels
are really fun when you're

200
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,679
tripping, because they'll start
swirling on you and

201
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,250
you'll be, like, hanging
on, like, ahh!

202
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,429

203
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,780
HAMILTON MORRIS: And what was
your experience with drugs

204
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,020
before having met Gordon
"Todd" Skinner?

205
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,490
KRYSTLE COLE: Virtually none.

206
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,160
Of course, I did the normal
drinking alcohol, smoking pot.

207
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,130
I tried meth twice and
I did coke once.

208
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,210
But other than that--

209
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,860
I'd never even heard of MDMA.

210
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,560
I didn't even know
what it was.

211
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,300
All I know is, he's like, it'll
make you feel good.

212
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,070
Just try it.

213
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,690
You like it.

214
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:02,960
Don't worry.

215
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,110
You'll like it.

216
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,620
And boy, did I.

217
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,090
Back then, I was on so many
different substances.

218
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,070
It was like living in an
entheogenic monastery, because

219
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,970
I didn't have to work.

220
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,920
I didn't have to worry
about paying bills.

221
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,200
I didn't have to do anything
other than use psychedelics

222
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,650
and pray to the god
that we all share.

223
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,260

224
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,270
The whole situation was centered
around tripping, so

225
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,880
we just wanted to
be comfortable.

226
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,710
This here is the missile bay.

227
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,610
About where the tanks are is
where we had a platform set up

228
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,370
with a stereo, and we would have
a couple of king-sized

229
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,190
beds in here and a bunch of
different couches, like

230
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,790
leather couches and things.

231
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,830
That way we could hang out and
have plenty of places to sit

232
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,640
down and lay down or whatever.

233
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,410
HAMILTON MORRIS: Todd spent
money with wild abandon,

234
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,560
decorating the silo with stone
statues, Persian carpets,

235
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,310
cedar saunas, a marble bathroom
with a tub large

236
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,850
enough to accommodate a
half-dozen people, and a

237
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,500
$120,000 stereo system, which
he used to play both Sarah

238
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,840
McLachlan and Deep Forest at
extremely high volumes.

239
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:25,260
[MUSIC PLAYING]

240
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,000
KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah, we would
all get in here and shower.

241
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,900
There was lots of nudity.

242
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,060
You can imagine, you
know, lots of cute

243
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,932
girls running around.

244
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:36,205
And the parties were-- could
get really wild.

245
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:39,060

246
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,450
One of the things they really
liked to do was have IVs set

247
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,930
up and have some DMT or some
5-MeO in the IV bottle.

248
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,520
They would sit there, and then
they would like, crank it up

249
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,470
so they'd start tripping more.

250
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,410
And then they'd roll it down
a little bit to kind of--

251
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,100
and so you could, like-- he
would like surf in the DMT

252
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,180
high, you know?

253
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,100
I would do a lot,
but not that.

254
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,320
Todd seemed like the most
spiritual person

255
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,100
you would ever meet.

256
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,800
And when we would trip
together, it was

257
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,680
like, I don't know.

258
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,260
Tripping with him is different
than tripping with anyone I've

259
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,570
ever tripped with, you know?

260
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,850
And we experienced things like
telepathy together, and you

261
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,280
know, we experienced
God, if you want to

262
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,330
label it that, together.

263
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,090
HAMILTON MORRIS: Krystle was
exposed to a cornucopia of

264
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,450
psychedelic substances, ranging
from the more common

265
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:30,100
chemicals like LSD, DMT, and
MDMA to such rarities as

266
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,490
ALD-52, ergot wine, a variety
of fluorinated AMT analogs,

267
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,570
and a mysterious substance
made by

268
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,080
Leonard called diazedine.

269
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,060
Unbeknownst to Krystle, Todd
and Leonard began to argue,

270
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,140
and Todd was slowly overcome by
fear of both Leonard and an

271
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,000
impending bust by the DEA.

272
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,165
KRYSTLE COLE: Todd was so
secretive about everything.

273
00:11:57,165 --> 00:12:00,780
A couple weeks before the bust
happened, he gave me some MDMA

274
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,580
and said, go in the bedroom and
trip and leave me alone.

275
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,460
Don't come out here.

276
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,915
So I was like, pretty high,
and I came out there, and

277
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:06,593
like, what are you doing?

278
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,750
I'm bored.

279
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,010
And so then I got to
see all the stuff.

280
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,150
He had pictures of Leonard and
all this stuff about Leonard,

281
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,790
like this huge file on him.

282
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,660
Looking back on it, I should've
known something was

283
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,580
getting ready to come down when
he had all that stuff

284
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,860
out, because then I could
have said, Leonard,

285
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,170
you gotta watch out.

286
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,990
KSNT REPORTER: Wamego residents
say they were

287
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,680
shocked when DEA agents arrived
into town on November

288
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,450
6, looking for drug fugitives.

289
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,680
HAMILTON MORRIS: In October
2000, Todd formally contacted

290
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,100
the DEA and declared that he
would like to turn in the

291
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,400
world's largest LSD
manufacturing conspiracy.

292
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,120
Todd received total immunity for
his involvement with the

293
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,450
laboratory and walked away a
free man, while Leonard was

294
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,940
chased by the DEA, outrunning
them on foot and hiding in a

295
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,090
barn with his body covered
with cold leaves to evade

296
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,460
thermal cameras.

297
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,750
The following day, Leonard was
turned in by a farmer and

298
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,740
eventually given two concurrent
life sentences

299
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,042
without parole.

300
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:06,310
MALE SPEAKER: Wamego Police
Department were brought in to

301
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,010
assist in the manhunt, which
ended up being an 18-hour hunt

302
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,950
for the individual.

303
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,330
KSNT REPORTER: DEA agents
believe the LSD lab is one of

304
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,420
the largest in the world.

305
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,620
HAMILTON MORRIS: After the
bust, Krystle and Todd

306
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,800
traveled across the country for
three years with a small

307
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,350
group of ravers and drug
enthusiasts, selling

308
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,910
phosphorescent capsules of
MDMA and living like

309
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,940
psychedelic royalty in Seattle,

310
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,590
Mendocino, Tucson, and Tulsa.

311
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,550
KRYSTLE COLE: Here's our
California house.

312
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,540
We had our own private
beach down there.

313
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,030
We would try to get the best
we could everywhere.

314
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,600
HAMILTON MORRIS: There were
peacocks on the property?

315
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,540
KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah.

316
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:41,860
Yeah.

317
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,430
There were peacocks
on the property.

318
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,870
You would think having
peacocks would be

319
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,110
cool, but it wasn't.

320
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,880
Outside of our houses was
all these Amanitas.

321
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,700
And so we would go pick
Amanitas and stuff.

322
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,910
You can see us, we're
identifying them and

323
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,860
researching them.

324
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,082
Some of these don't have Todd in
them, because he didn't let

325
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,350
us take a lot of pictures.

326
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,020
There towards the end, I think
all the stress of the court

327
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,920
case, and everything, you know,
the years of running,

328
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,800
and the years of all the
problems, you know, just

329
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,460
really were piling in on him.

330
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,700
And I think that he was
just kind of going

331
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,740
a little bit crazy.

332
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,720
Todd was very much escalating
things.

333
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,250
He started abusing me,
like literally

334
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,500
physically abusing me.

335
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,570
I was willing to look over some
of the bad stuff that I

336
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,350
started to see the first couple
years, because, oh, I

337
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,630
know underneath all this,
it's just the stress.

338
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,440
It's just temporary.

339
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,180
Underneath all that, he's this
beautiful, spiritual person.

340
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,140
And he's doing all this
for good reasons.

341
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,540
And now looking back on
it, no, he was just

342
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,690
manipulating me.

343
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,610
I was--

344
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,010
I was just a stupid girl.

345
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,670
You know?

346
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,910
He always had a couple of
other girlfriends, and I

347
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,180
always had boyfriends.

348
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,950
And we were each other's
primary, you know, I mean, but

349
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,680
like we always had other
people around.

350
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,660
And so the boyfriend at the
time, Brad, he was the first

351
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,270
guy over the years that I dated
that wanted-- that said,

352
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,600
look, this situation's
no good.

353
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,850
You need to get away
from this.

354
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,322
And so, so I'm like, OK, well,
the only way for us to get out

355
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:06,620
of this is for us to go to the
DEA and basically do what Todd

356
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,950
did to Leonard to Todd.

357
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,600
And so we go to the DEA
together, and we basically

358
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,725
spill everything about Todd's
local operation that he's got

359
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:16,440
going there.

360
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,550
They were already familiar with
the Pickard case and all

361
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,120
that stuff.

362
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,830
And so they knew who I was, that
I was Todd's girlfriend

363
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,250
and all that.

364
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,300
They had a case.

365
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,940
They had me.

366
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,030
They had the boyfriend.

367
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,890
And I told them where
one of his labs was.

368
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,090
So they had more than enough
of a case, and more than

369
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,100
enough of a reason
to go after him.

370
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,240
You know what they said to me?

371
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,570
They're like, well, we'll
give you a call.

372
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,600
And I'm like, OK.

373
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,560
And so they had my
phone number.

374
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,180
So I go home.

375
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,130
And then conveniently, two days
later, Todd called me up.

376
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,720
Well, I know you went
into the DEA.

377
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,990
HAMILTON MORRIS: So you
went into the DEA.

378
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,870
You told them that
he was dangerous.

379
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,160
They took down all
the information.

380
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,760
Didn't do anything at
all to stop him.

381
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,700
But told him that you had
reported him and just

382
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,020
infuriated him?

383
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,620
KRYSTLE COLE: Yes.

384
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,040
And that is why he kidnapped me
and Brad and did the things

385
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,840
that he did to us.

386
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,570
HAMILTON MORRIS: On the 4th of
July, 2003, believing he was

387
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,900
immune to legal prosecution,
Todd lured Krystle and Brad to

388
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,390
the Tulsa Doubletree Inn.

389
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,670
Shortly after meeting, Todd
offered Brad a communion wafer

390
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,700
laced with an unknown
psilocin analog.

391
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,990
KRYSTLE COLE: The next thing I
know, he's duct-taped up, and

392
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,580
they were injecting
him with stuff.

393
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,740
And they were telling me, you
know, if you don't obey

394
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,940
everything we say, we're going
to give him something that's

395
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,710
going to kill him.

396
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,600
And we have to get information
out of him.

397
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,400
We have to know what he said.

398
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,180
HAMILTON MORRIS: As the drug
took effect, Todd taped Brad

399
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,280
up and spent one week subjecting
him to psychedelic

400
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,650
tortures of unfathomable
depravity.

401
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,080

402
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,890
KRYSTLE COLE: I know that he
was giving him stuff like

403
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,110
barbiturates and things
like Valium and stuff.

404
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,690
HAMILTON MORRIS: But
he was using

405
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,430
psychedelics as a truth serum?

406
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:50,680
KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah.

407
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,280
And he was using psychedelics
as well.

408
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,270
He was giving him IV DMT.

409
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,525
Any drug he had, he pretty much
was giving it to him.

410
00:16:57,525 --> 00:17:00,160
You know, and after that, after
it was over, I had to

411
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,030
stay with Todd for
a whole month.

412
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,445
And I mean, he drugged me, he
raped me, he sodomized me, he

413
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:04,970
did horrible things to me.

414
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,460
It's hard for me to talk about,
because I have PTSD now

415
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,300
because of what he did.

416
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,130
But I mean, it's horrendous.

417
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,770
I mean, to think that somebody
would use psychedelics for the

418
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,200
kinds of things he
used them for.

419
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,260
HAMILTON MORRIS: Todd fled to
Burning Man, where he was

420
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,710
arrested for MDMA distribution
and ultimately tried for

421
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,260
kidnapping and assault with
a dangerous weapon.

422
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,555
For these acts, Todd was
sentenced to life in prison.

423
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:35,953

424
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:37,990
KRYSTLE COLE: Todd was so tall
that he had to really watch

425
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,885
out for those things, or he
would hit his head on them.

426
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:43,610

427
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,010
KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah.

428
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,314
He has life, so you don't have
to worry about him coming back

429
00:17:47,314 --> 00:17:49,450
and haunting the place here.

430
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,580
Once you trip a lot, you can
make any trip a pleasant

431
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,040
experience.

432
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,670
Unless the person's literally
standing above you and

433
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,840
injecting you and strangling
and threatening you and

434
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,650
yelling at you and stuff.

435
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,870
You can't-- there's no way
to make that good.

436
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,420
The last few years have been a
difficult road for me to walk

437
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,330
down, yet they have made me
a much better person.

438
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,450
I got so far out of touch with
a normal person's reality.

439
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,550
For years, I never worked a job,
watched television, or

440
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,400
even went a week without
being around someone

441
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,920
who was on an entheogen.

442
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,470
I basically had to start
life all over.

443
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,850
I began watching the news to
get up to speed on current

444
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,450
events, got an apartment of my
own, and started a business to

445
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,350
support myself.

446
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,840
I feel like even after four
years, I'm still working on

447
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,100
reintegrating into society.

448
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,090
In the spirit of actually doing
something with what I've

449
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,210
learned through entheogens, I
founded a nonprofit website

450
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,790
called NeuroSoup.com.

451
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,480
My hope is that it will be a
place for people to learn,

452
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,280
share their beliefs about
spirituality, entheogens, and

453
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,120
themselves.

454
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,370
Namaste.

455
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,280

456
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,290
HAMILTON MORRIS: After
everything that has

457
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,240
transpired, Krystle still
considers Todd

458
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,100
the love of her life.

459
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,240
We are all brothers in the
family of humanity, and life

460
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,420
is a cosmic giggle on the
breath of the universe.

461
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,670
Namaste.

462
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:20,950
