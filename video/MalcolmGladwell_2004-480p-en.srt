1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
I think I was supposed to talk about my new book,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,820
which is called "Blink," and it's about snap judgments and first impressions.

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,820
And it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
But I was thinking about this,

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
and I realized that although my new book makes me happy,

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,820
and I think would make my mother happy,

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
it's not really about happiness.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,820
So I decided instead, I would talk about someone who

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,820
I think has done as much to make Americans happy

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,820
as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
a man who is a great personal hero of mine:

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,820
who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,820
Howard's about this high, and he's round,

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,820
and he's in his 60s, and he has big huge glasses

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,820
and thinning grey hair, and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality,

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,820
and he has a parrot, and he loves the opera,

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,820
and he's a great aficionado of medieval history.

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,820
And by profession, he's a psychophysicist.

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,820
Now, I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is,

21
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,820
although at some point in my life, I dated a girl for two years who was getting

22
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
her doctorate in psychophysics.

23
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,820
Which should tell you something about that relationship. (Laughter)

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
As far as I know, psychophysics is about measuring things.

25
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
And Howard is very interested in measuring things.

26
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard,

27
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,820
and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York.

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,820
And one of his first clients was -- this is many years ago, back in the early '70s

29
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
-- one of his first clients was Pepsi.

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
And Pepsi came to Howard and they said,

31
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
"You know, there's this new thing called aspartame,

32
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,820
and we would like to make Diet Pepsi.

33
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in

34
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,820
each can of Diet Pepsi, in order to have the perfect drink." Right?

35
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,820
Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer,

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
and that's what Howard thought. Because Pepsi told him,

37
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,820
"Look, we're working with a band between eight and 12 percent.

38
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,820
Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough;

39
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,820
anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet.

40
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,820
We want to know: what's the sweet spot between eight and 12?"

41
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,820
Now, if I gave you this problem to do, you would all say, it's very simple.

42
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,820
What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi,

43
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,820
at every degree of sweetness -- eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,

44
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,820
all the way up to 12 -- and we try this out with thousands of people,

45
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,820
and we plot the results on a curve,

46
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,820
and we take the most popular concentration. Right? Really simple.

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
Howard does the experiment, and he gets the data back, and he plots it on a curve,

48
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,820
and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve.

49
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,820
In fact, the data doesn't make any sense.

50
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,820
It's a mess. It's all over the place.

51
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,820
Now, most people in that business, in the world of testing food and such,

52
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess.

53
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,820
They think, well, you know, figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy.

54
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way.

55
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
You know, let's just make an educated guess,

56
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,820
and they simply point and they go for 10 percent, right in the middle.

57
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
Howard is not so easily placated.

58
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,820
Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards.

59
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
And this was not good enough for him,

60
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
and this question bedeviled him for years.

61
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
And he would think it through and say, what was wrong?

62
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,820
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?

63
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,820
And one day, he was sitting in a diner in White Plains,

64
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescafe.

65
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,820
And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him.

66
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,820
And that is, that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data,

67
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
they were asking the wrong question.

68
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
They were looking for the perfect Pepsi,

69
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,820
and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis. Trust me.

70
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
This was an enormous revelation.

71
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,820
This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science.

72
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
And Howard immediately went on the road,

73
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
and he would go to conferences around the country,

74
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
and he would stand up and he would say,

75
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,820
"You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi. You're wrong.

76
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis."

77
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
And people would look at him with a blank look, and they would say,

78
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
"What are you talking about? This is craziness."

79
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
And they would say, you know, "Move! Next!"

80
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
Tried to get business, nobody would hire him -- he was obsessed, though,

81
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,820
and he talked about it and talked about it and talked about it.

82
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,820
Howard loves the Yiddish expression

83
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,820
"To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish."

84
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,820
This was his horseradish. (Laughter) He was obsessed with it!

85
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,820
And finally, he had a breakthrough. Vlasic Pickles came to him,

86
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,820
and they said, "Mr. Moskowitz -- Doctor Moskowitz --

87
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
we want to make the perfect pickle." And he said,

88
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,820
"There is no perfect pickle; there are only perfect pickles."

89
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,820
And he came back to them and he said, "You don't just need to improve your regular;

90
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
you need to create zesty."

91
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,820
And that's where we got zesty pickles.

92
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
Then the next person came to him, and that was Campbell's Soup.

93
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
And this was even more important. In fact,

94
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,820
Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation.

95
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,820
Campbell's made Prego, and Prego, in the early '80s, was struggling next to Ragu,

96
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the '70s and '80s.

97
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,820
Now in the industry -- I don't know whether you care about this,

98
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,820
or how much time I have to go into this.

99
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
But it was, technically speaking -- this is an aside --

100
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragu.

101
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,820
The quality of the tomato paste is much better; the spice mix is far superior;

102
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way. In fact,

103
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,820
they would do the famous bowl test back in the '70s with Ragu and Prego.

104
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
You'd have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right?

105
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,820
And the Ragu would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top.

106
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
That's called "adherence."

107
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,820
And, anyway, despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence,

108
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,820
and the quality of their tomato paste, Prego was struggling.

109
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
So they came to Howard, and they said, fix us.

110
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
And Howard looked at their product line, and he said,

111
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,820
what you have is a dead tomato society.

112
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
So he said, this is what I want to do.

113
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen,

114
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,820
and he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce. And he varied them

115
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,820
according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce:

116
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,820
by sweetness, by level of garlic, by tartness, by sourness, by tomatoey-ness,

117
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:36,820
by visible solids -- my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business. (Laughter)

118
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce, he varied spaghetti sauce.

119
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,820
And then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces, and he went on the road.

120
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
He went to New York; he went to Chicago; he went to Jacksonville;

121
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,820
he went to Los Angeles. And he brought in people by the truckload. Into big halls.

122
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
And he sat them down for two hours, and he gave them,

123
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
over the course of that two hours, ten bowls.

124
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,820
Ten small bowls of pasta, with a different spaghetti sauce on each one.

125
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,820
And after they ate each bowl, they had to rate, from 0 to 100,

126
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,820
how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was.

127
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,820
At the end of that process, after doing it for months and months,

128
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
he had a mountain of data

129
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,820
about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce.

130
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
And then he analyzed the data.

131
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,820
Now, did he look for the most popular brand variety of spaghetti sauce? No!

132
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing.

133
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Instead, he looked at the data, and he said,

134
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,820
let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters.

135
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,820
Let's see if they congregate around certain ideas.

136
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,820
And sure enough, if you sit down, and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce,

137
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,820
you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.

138
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain;

139
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy;

140
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,820
and there are people who like it extra chunky.

141
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,820
And of those three facts, the third one was the most significant,

142
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
because at the time, in the early 1980s,

143
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
if you went to a supermarket,

144
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,820
you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.

145
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
And Prego turned to Howard, and they said,

146
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:16,820
"You telling me that one third of Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce

147
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,820
and yet no one is servicing their needs?" And he said yes!

148
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
(Laughter) And Prego then went back,

149
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce,

150
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,820
and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely

151
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,820
took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country.

152
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,820
And over the next 10 years, they made 600 million dollars

153
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,820
off their line of extra-chunky sauces.

154
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,820
And everyone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done, and they said,

155
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
"Oh my god! We've been thinking all wrong!"

156
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,820
And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar,

157
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,820
and 14 different kinds of mustard, and 71 different kinds of olive oil --

158
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,820
and then eventually even Ragu hired Howard,

159
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,820
and Howard did the exact same thing for Ragu that he did for Prego.

160
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,820
And today, if you go to the supermarket, a really good one,

161
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,820
and you look at how many Ragus there are --

162
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,820
do you know how many they are? 36!

163
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,820
In six varieties: Cheese, Light, Robusto,

164
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Rich & Hearty, Old World Traditional, Extra-Chunky Garden. (Laughter)

165
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,820
That's Howard's doing. That is Howard's gift to the American people.

166
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Now why is that important?

167
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,820
It is, in fact, enormously important. I'll explain to you why.

168
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks

169
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,820
about making you happy.

170
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
Assumption number one in the food industry used to be

171
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
that the way to find out what people want to eat --

172
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
what will make people happy -- is to ask them.

173
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
And for years and years and years and years, Ragu and Prego would have

174
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,820
focus groups, and they would sit all you people down, and they would say,

175
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,820
"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce? Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce."

176
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
And for all those years -- 20, 30 years --

177
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
through all those focus group sessions,

178
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,820
no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.

179
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Even though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did.

180
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
(Laughter)

181
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
People don't know what they want! Right?

182
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,820
As Howard loves to say, "The mind knows not what the tongue wants."

183
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,820
It's a mystery!

184
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,820
And a critically important step in understanding our own desires

185
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,820
and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want deep down.

186
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,820
If I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee,

187
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:42,820
you know what you'd say? Every one of you would say, "I want a dark, rich, hearty roast."

188
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
It's what people always say when you ask them what they want in a coffee.

189
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,820
What do you like? Dark, rich, hearty roast!

190
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,820
What percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast?

191
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
According to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you.

192
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Most of you like milky, weak coffee.

193
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
But you will never, ever say to someone who asks you what you want

194
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
that "I want a milky, weak coffee." (Laughter)

195
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,820
So that's number one thing that Howard did.

196
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize --

197
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
it's another very critical point --

198
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,820
he made us realize in the importance of what he likes to call "horizontal segmentation."

199
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
Why is this critical? It's critical because

200
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
this is the way the food industry thought before Howard. Right?

201
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,820
What were they obsessed with in the early '80s? They were obsessed with mustard.

202
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
In particular, they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon. Right?

203
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
Used to be, there were two mustards. French's and Gulden's.

204
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
What were they? Yellow mustard. What's in yellow mustard?

205
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,820
Yellow mustard seeds, turmeric, and paprika. That was mustard.

206
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon. Right?

207
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,820
Much more volatile brown mustard seed, some white wine, a nose hit,

208
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,820
much more delicate aromatics. And what do they do?

209
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,820
They put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it,

210
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,820
made it look French, even though it's made in Oxnard, California.

211
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,820
And instead of charging a dollar-fifty for the eight-ounce bottle,

212
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
the way that French's and Gulden's did, they decided to charge four dollars.

213
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,820
And then they had those ads, right? With the guy in the Rolls Royce,

214
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
and he's eating the Grey Poupon. The other Rolls Royce pulls up,

215
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
and he says, do you have any Grey Poupon?

216
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,820
And the whole thing, after they did that, Grey Poupon takes off!

217
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
Takes over the mustard business!

218
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
And everyone's take-home lesson from that was

219
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,820
that the way to get to make people happy

220
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,820
is to give them something that is more expensive, something to aspire to. Right?

221
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,820
It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now,

222
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,820
and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy.

223
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
A better mustard! A more expensive mustard!

224
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning.

225
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
And Howard looked to that and said, that's wrong!

226
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy.

227
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,820
Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane.

228
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
There is no good mustard or bad mustard.

229
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard.

230
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,820
There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people.

231
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,820
He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste.

232
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,820
And for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.

233
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,820
Third thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important,

234
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,820
is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish. (Laughter)

235
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
What do I mean by that?

236
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
For the longest time in the food industry,

237
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,820
there was a sense that there was one way, a perfect way, to make a dish.

238
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,820
You go to Chez Panisse, they give you the red-tail sashimi

239
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,820
with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction.

240
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
They don't give you five options on the reduction, right?

241
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,820
They don't say, do you want the extra-chunky reduction, or do you want the -- no!

242
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
You just get the reduction. Why? Because the chef at Chez Panisse

243
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
has a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi.

244
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
This is the way it ought to be.

245
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,820
And she serves it that way time and time again,

246
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
and if you quarrel with her, she will say,

247
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,820
"You know what? You're wrong! This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant."

248
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well.

249
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
They had a notion, a Platonic notion, of what tomato sauce was.

250
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
And where did that come from? It came from Italy.

251
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,820
Italian tomato sauce is what? It's blended; it's thin.

252
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,820
The culture of tomato sauce was thin.

253
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,820
When we talked about authentic tomato sauce in the 1970s,

254
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,820
we talked about Italian tomato sauce. We talked about the earliest ragus,

255
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,820
which had no visible solids, right?

256
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
Which were thin, and you just put a little bit over it

257
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta.

258
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
That's what it was. And why were we attached to that?

259
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Because we thought that what it took to make people happy

260
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:52,820
was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A;

261
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,820
and B, we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce,

262
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
then they would embrace it.

263
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,820
And that's what would please the maximum number of people.

264
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
And the reason we thought that -- in other words,

265
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,820
people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals.

266
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,820
They were looking for one way to treat all of us.

267
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
And it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals,

268
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,820
because all of science, through the 19th century and much of the 20th,

269
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
was obsessed with universals.

270
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,820
Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in finding out

271
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
the rules that govern the way all of us behave.

272
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
But that changed, right?

273
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,820
What is the great revolution in science of the last 10, 15 years?

274
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:39,820
It is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability.

275
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Now in medical science, we don't want to know how necessarily --

276
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,820
just how cancer works, we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer.

277
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,820
I guess my cancer different from your cancer.

278
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability.

279
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, this same revolution

280
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,820
needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce.

281
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,820
And for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks.

282
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,820
I'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that is -- oh, I'm sorry.

283
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,820
Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step,

284
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,820
which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food,

285
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,820
we aren't just making an error; we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice.

286
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
And the example he used was coffee.

287
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,820
And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafe.

288
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,820
If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee

289
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,820
-- a type of coffee, a brew -- that made all of you happy,

290
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
and then I asked you to rate that coffee,

291
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,820
the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.

292
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,820
If, however, you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters,

293
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
maybe three or four coffee clusters,

294
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,820
and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters,

295
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,820
your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.

296
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,820
The difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78

297
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,820
is a difference between coffee that makes you wince,

298
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,820
and coffee that makes you deliriously happy.

299
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,820
That is the final, and I think most beautiful lesson, of Howard Moskowitz:

300
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,820
that in embracing the diversity of human beings,

301
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,820
we will find a surer way to true happiness.

302
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
Thank you.
