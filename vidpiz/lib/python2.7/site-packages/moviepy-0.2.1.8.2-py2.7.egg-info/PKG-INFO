Description: MoviePy
        ========
        
        MoviePy (full documentation here_) is a Python module for script-based movie editing.
        
        It can read and write to many formats, `including  animated GIFs <http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/01/23/making-animated-gifs-from-video-files-with-python/>`_, and enables basic operations (cuts, concatenations, title insertions) to be done in a few lines. It can also be used for advanced compositing.
        
        A typical MoviePy script looks like that: ::
        
            from moviepy.editor import *
            
            # Load myHolidays.mp4 and select the subclip 00:00:50 - 00:00:60
            clip = VideoFileClip("myHolidays.mp4").subclip(50,60)
            
            # Generate a text clip (many options available ! )
            txt_clip = TextClip("My Holidays 2013",fontsize=70,color='white')
            txt_clip = txt_clip.set_pos('center').set_duration(10)
            
            # Overlay the text clip above the first clip
            final_clip = CompositeVideoClip([clip, txt_clip])
            
            # write the result to a file in any format
            final_clip.to_videofile("myHolidays_edited.avi",fps=25, codec='mpeg4')

        Download and Installation
        ---------------------------
        
        MoviePy requires the Python modules Numpy_, Decorator_, and tqdm_. All of these will all be automatically installed during MoviePy's installation.
        
        You will also need a **recent version** of the software ffmpeg_ , preferably downloaded directly from the ffmpeg website.
        
        If you intend to use advanced features you must install a few other dependencies like ImageMagick_ , Pygame_ etc. (see `the docs <http://zulko.github.io/moviepy/install.html>`_).
        
        First installation method : if you have ``pip`` installed, just type this in a terminal (sudo is optional on some systems) ::
            
            (sudo) pip install moviepy
        
        Second method : by hand. Download the sources, either on PyPI_ or (if you want the development version) on Github_, unzip everything in one folder, open a terminal and type ::
            
            (sudo) python setup.py install
            
        Linking to ffmpeg
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you put have a ffmpeg binary in you executable folder (on Linux it will be ``/usr/bin``) it will be detected automatically by MoviePy. Else make sure that MoviePy can locate ffmpeg on your computer by running the script ``moviepy/conf.py`` that is in the sources. It it fails, then you must enter the path to the FFMPEG executable in the first line of this file ::
            
            FFMPEG_BINARY = path/to/your/ffmpeg
