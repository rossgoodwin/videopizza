of well to me that he was the most clever home trying to avoid her mister people's belongs molinaro as you know sandy will approach the mid-atlantic coast later this weekend arts and he is very likely to feel its effects in the former high tides high winds and heavy rainfall lasting for several days well are going to be honest with you said in the article was very scary it was amazing to come believe that my refrigerator was born in around like a bowl my bed my two cats had doctor for into my mattress they want more I was trying to pull them what they want Kamau and our we're just waiting for part about bombing use the work then there that was all that respect these are the only thing for white worms for government my warrior a reading of it forward officials or part pair my cousin that if someone came along and offered you a hundred thousand dollars you better take your anything because our house was work place right now so when I heard about the bar down I was thrilled part I will have to stay mad at her picking a hundred thousand dollars I'm taking it just moreover and then with the 22nd people I signed the papers on Thursday I just found out from you that my old home demolish it's going to be fair to fear grow their own by actually gonna be are more swampy area now order creek running down the middle or all the stuff from the house that I wore starring the lot that were from a lifetime of gathering up than are very values just memories growing up those will be the biggest things and it was my first home wanted the first neighborhoods are people got together after the storm was in Oakwood beach on staten island where the residents were already pretty organized because they had organized a flood victims committee in the neighborhood dating back to 1982 and even before when they'd been recurrently flooded for many years they've been waiting for better storm protection and so before there is even really a presence from from the state on the ground they're already talking about what should we do actually rebuild and so they decided that they wanted to seek state buyout so the a move it kinda federal buyout programs is to remove we're currently flooded property is and turn them back into open space so the surname idea that you hear basically you know moving back from the waterfront in allowing places to flood that will ideally make make others safer and what's really changed after sandy is talking about this in terms of longer-term adaptation to climate change though it not only thinking about how do we rebuild to be favor from the next storm but more about how do we have to change everyday life to be safer from things that are going to get worse and worse and worse and worse this really for it to work people need to want to do it themselves that needs to be initiated by the residents in these areas given all the barrels a living in an area like this its it's not a good decision this day it's really not and in the only reason you which day is because you just not thinking clearly we have a sentimental attachment that you just can't break I am with the leader of the Oakwood beach by a committee to three weeks after the storm II was convinced there was no way I was gonna never rebuild and I had to just figure a way have basically recouping my investment and moving on I learned about this program I spoke to two different communities that have gone through this program it's a federal program the government will buy out your home but when they do is they give you the priest on value so on we put together our entire proposal we had including maps spreadsheet all the homes blocking lot number and a signature an acclimation from each and every homeowner that name knew that the program is voluntary and that was voluntary and both sides and they signed their names and their interest I was shocked because I knew that the area the people that I was talking to for those weeks were brothers and sisters aunts uncles grandmothers I said there's no way they don't think this area but they had it a day and an even to this day I just spoke to one the people on the committee you know they all describe it as bittersweet but she knows she just told me last night it was the right decision there's no way in the world check even imagine living there again all I keep on fighting in I will fight them and as long as it stands I will fight them in a war game ass they want everybody else namely they're gonna buy you out by as far as people that own mortgages and stuff like that and her over the head and mortgages really dozen really work out for them type people like by and behind in my mortgage they wanted to give me 269,000 which I'll 409,000 so was gone all the bank a difference with nothing you know nothing you know nothing Nolan of I don't think it's about being really care for people in its name they don't really care they care about pain the funds out again over and over again when is a flight and is a flood I got stuffed in the basement lost this I lost that gotta keep on paying fines is a way of making money from the state we still need help down here any it's not over and it's a lot of grief it's it's a lot appoint hand too thin forty-three is all along great because all the sand nation the mortgage company by the way has been giving me a hard time I came here three o'clock the guys were in this house trying to lock up my whole for the mortgage and now they tell me the last hearing i you can get a mortgage unless the house is renovated but I have no money to renovate a house the insurance money is to renovate a house you know give me the money to renovate the house make and no one else basically they doing everything it takes to try to force me at his house I'm not worried about the next to lawmakers I actually relocated most and pipes when he was supposed to be an and now relocated firmness I think because I got everything up here have nothing I got to really like people I was nice government for all the homes that were girls still have the neighborhood in Staten Island at our first meeting in the buyout program there is Oakwood beach ocean breeze and Grampy its Oakwood beach in its total areas over 400 parcels I'm I love that in the majority a purchases will happen where we actually up structures we have homes there so we're buying over 320 16-piece parcels and we rough finish acquisition this neighborhood in the next 12 months in with that mean acquisition and demolition of all the structures I it would be another 18 months to finish ocean breeze and probably another twenty four months to complete Grand Beach I think there are challenges at two having a broad stroke approach to this hyper strategic retreats on and so I think that ambien is going to be a community level interest in this and and also you unfortunately for Sun there's going to have to be another catastrophic events and to be able to recognize this this impact in the fact that these these are going to become more regular and that we are going have significant impacts from climate change the long run you were not used to this this is this is a transformative moment the storms are more ferocious and more frequent the science is very clear on that people sometimes they think aboul a storm and they say well we shouldn't we shouldn't live in a dense way we should live in a kind more dispersed way and that's gonna protect us during a storm actually be officers true I think we have enough density to support kinda redundant systems and more robust systems that are more expensive but you're spreading possible more people in a dense area you actually have a long resilience is just a question then designing these buildings correctly so we have a bunch buildings were designing that are in the post and the environment a lot of that is about understanding that sometimes these buildings will flood and when they flooded how will people still use them and I think words can actually get much tougher is some other these more more vulnerable areas are gonna flood and then fled again and again and again and it it is really all that the eastern seaboard you can see and I think it's going to get tougher and tougher for us to be able to societies day it's okay you know have this many people get injured lose their lives there's gonna be some way in which in these neighborhoods a really good to reformulate well the Laura I is rising temperatures at the global issue certainly by when it happens in experience for you what happens at a very local level so it intersects with vulnerabilities that already exist locally people who are the most vulnerable in a particular neighborhood or city an everyday level they're going to have the hardest time coping with the effects of this as well as adopting to climate change and I think there's also urged going to look at it really individually to look at a house by house and think okay you know this house you wanna buy out yes or no but is a relief social decisions you know things like after after sandy there's a lot of talk lately how do we protect lower Manhattan because it has such a high concentration of economic activity there so much well and so you know lower Manhattan probably won't have to do a measure tree me there's going to be a lot of public and private investment that prioritizes protecting the appli- and so the very political decision the end of the day which places get protected which places have to move which places do residents get a move on their own terms which places people just gradually go into foreclosure have to leave you know who has the resources start over again somewhere else who's given assistance do that and who isn't all those questions really are our social and political questions Mike to move here army to listen to require and at night when it was very by hear the waves Berkshire it was really a common affliction fitness area are common I could also tell when it was gonna rain causes getaway splash in the ruling was coming on its war whatever the wave solder rations
