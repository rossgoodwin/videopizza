1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,910
of

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:03,610
well

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,690
0

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:11,610
to me that he was the most clever home

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,830
trying to avoid her mister people's
belongs

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,830
molinaro

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,310
as you know sandy will approach the
mid-atlantic coast

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,140
later this weekend arts and he is very
likely to feel its effects

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,630
in the former high tides high winds and
heavy rainfall lasting for several days

10
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,720
well are going to be honest with you
said in the article was very scary

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,370
it was amazing to come believe that my
refrigerator was born in around like a

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:51,920
bowl

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,790
my bed my two cats had doctor

14
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,290
for into my mattress they want more

15
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,960
I was trying to pull them what they want
Kamau and our

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,830
we're just waiting for part about
bombing

17
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,010
use the work then there that was all
that respect

18
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,060
these are the only thing for white worms
for

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,780
government my warrior a reading of it
forward officials or

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,500
part pair my cousin

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,080
that if someone came along and offered
you a hundred thousand dollars

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,550
you better take your anything because
our house was work place right now

23
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,670
so when I heard about the bar down I was
thrilled part I will have to stay mad at

24
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,090
her

25
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,240
picking a hundred thousand dollars I'm
taking it just

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,250
moreover and then with the 22nd

27
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,650
people I signed the papers

28
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,500
on Thursday I just found out from you

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,460
that my old home demolish it's going to
be fair to fear

30
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,470
grow their own by actually gonna be

31
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,340
are more swampy area now order creek
running down the middle or

32
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,300
all the stuff from the house that I wore
starring the lot that were

33
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,330
from a lifetime of gathering up than

34
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,280
are very values just memories growing up

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,280
those will be the biggest things

36
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:28,370
and it was my first home

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,640
wanted the first neighborhoods are
people got together after the storm was

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,769
in Oakwood beach

39
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:39,140
on staten island where the residents
were already pretty organized because

40
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,980
they had organized a flood victims
committee in the neighborhood dating

41
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,380
back to 1982 and even before when they'd
been recurrently

42
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,480
flooded for many years they've been
waiting for better

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,950
storm protection and so before

44
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,780
there is even really a presence from
from the state

45
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,349
on the ground they're already talking
about what should we do actually rebuild

46
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,849
and so they decided that they wanted to
seek state buyout

47
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,989
so the a move it kinda federal buyout
programs

48
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,420
is to remove we're currently flooded
property is

49
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,650
and turn them back into open space so

50
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,829
the surname idea that you hear basically
you know moving back

51
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:23,450
from the waterfront in allowing places
to flood that will ideally make

52
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,660
make others safer and what's really
changed after sandy

53
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,370
is talking about this in terms of
longer-term adaptation to climate change

54
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,880
though it not only thinking about how do
we rebuild to be favor from the next

55
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,560
storm

56
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,319
but more about how do we have to change
everyday life

57
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,079
to be safer from things that are going
to get worse and worse and worse and

58
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,590
worse

59
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,260
this really for it to work people need
to

60
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,700
want to do it themselves that needs to
be initiated by the residents in these

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,340
areas given

62
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,190
all the barrels a living in an area like
this its it's not a good decision this

63
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,639
day

64
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,209
it's really not and in the only reason
you which day is because you just not

65
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,079
thinking clearly

66
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,260
we have a sentimental attachment that
you just can't break

67
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,480
I am with the leader of the Oakwood
beach by a committee

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,769
to three weeks after the storm II was
convinced there was no way

69
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,419
I was gonna never rebuild and I had to
just figure a way

70
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:23,500
have basically recouping my investment
and moving on

71
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,960
I learned about this program I spoke to
two different communities that have gone

72
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,160
through this program it's a federal
program

73
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,120
the government will buy out your home
but when they do is they give you the

74
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,190
priest on value

75
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,050
so on we put together our entire
proposal

76
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,360
we had including maps spreadsheet all
the homes blocking lot number

77
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,729
and a signature an acclimation from each

78
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:49,750
and every homeowner that name knew that
the program is voluntary

79
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,780
and that was voluntary and both sides
and they signed their names and their

80
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,460
interest

81
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,479
I was shocked because I knew that the
area the people that I was talking to

82
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,300
for those weeks

83
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,110
were brothers and sisters aunts uncles
grandmothers I said there's no way they

84
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,240
don't think this area

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,389
but they had it a day and an even to
this day I just spoke to one the people

86
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,350
on the committee

87
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,560
you know they all describe it as
bittersweet but she knows she just told

88
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,280
me last night it was the right decision
there's no way in the world

89
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,880
check even imagine living there again
all

90
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,199
I keep on fighting in I will fight them
and

91
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,480
as long as it stands I will fight them
in a war game

92
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,000
ass they want everybody else namely
they're gonna buy you out by

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,540
as far as people that own mortgages and
stuff like that and her over the head

94
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,760
and mortgages

95
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,530
really dozen really work out for them
type people like

96
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,630
by and behind in my mortgage

97
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,370
they wanted to give me 269,000 which
I'll 409,000

98
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,510
so was gone all the bank a difference
with nothing

99
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,560
you know nothing you know nothing Nolan

100
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,070
of I don't think it's about being really
care for people in its name

101
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,170
they don't really care they care about
pain the funds out again

102
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,650
over and over again when is a flight

103
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,490
and is a flood I got stuffed in the
basement lost this I lost that

104
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,490
gotta keep on paying fines is a way of
making money from the state

105
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,440
we still need help down here any it's
not over

106
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,600
and it's a lot of grief it's it's a lot
appoint hand

107
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,980
too thin forty-three is all along great
because all the sand

108
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,090
nation the mortgage company by the way
has been giving me a hard time

109
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,900
I came here three o'clock the guys were
in this house trying to lock up my whole

110
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,180
for the mortgage and now they tell me

111
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,030
the last hearing i you can get a
mortgage unless the house is renovated

112
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,000
but I have no money to renovate a house
the insurance money is to renovate a

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,490
house

114
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,080
you know give me the money to renovate
the house make and no one else

115
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,400
basically they doing everything it takes
to try to force me at his house

116
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,180
I'm not worried about the next to
lawmakers

117
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,140
I actually relocated most and pipes when
he was supposed to be an

118
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,670
and now relocated firmness I think
because I got everything up here

119
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:16,670
have nothing

120
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,650
I got to really like people I was nice

121
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:40,220
government

122
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:47,220
for all the homes that were girls

123
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:01,309
still have the neighborhood in Staten
Island at our first meeting in the

124
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:02,169
buyout program

125
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,269
there is Oakwood beach ocean breeze and
Grampy

126
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:10,269
its Oakwood beach in its total areas
over 400 parcels

127
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:13,429
I'm I love that in the majority a

128
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:16,589
purchases will happen where we actually
up structures we have homes there

129
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:20,539
so we're buying over 320 16-piece
parcels

130
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,689
and we rough finish acquisition this
neighborhood

131
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:27,659
in the next 12 months in with that mean
acquisition and demolition of all the

132
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:28,479
structures

133
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,110
I it would be another 18 months to
finish ocean breeze and probably another

134
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,469
twenty four months to complete Grand
Beach

135
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,639
I think there are challenges

136
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:40,860
at two having a broad stroke approach to
this hyper

137
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,160
strategic retreats on and so I think
that ambien is going to be a community

138
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,639
level interest in this

139
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,829
and and also you unfortunately

140
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:55,130
for Sun there's going to have to be
another catastrophic events

141
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,560
and to be able to recognize this

142
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,380
this impact in the fact that these these
are going to become more regular and

143
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,610
that we are going have

144
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,120
significant impacts from climate change
the long run

145
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,520
you were not used to this this is this
is a transformative moment

146
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,970
the storms are more ferocious and more
frequent

147
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,780
the science is very clear on that people
sometimes they think

148
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,000
aboul a storm and they say well we
shouldn't we shouldn't live

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,400
in a dense way we should live in a kind
more dispersed way and that's gonna

150
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,890
protect us during a storm

151
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,930
actually be officers true I think we
have enough density

152
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,550
to support kinda redundant systems and
more robust systems that are more

153
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,030
expensive but you're spreading

154
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,470
possible more people in a dense area you
actually have a long

155
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,250
resilience is just a question then
designing these buildings correctly

156
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,090
so we have a bunch buildings were
designing that are in the post and the

157
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,030
environment

158
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,580
a lot of that is about understanding
that sometimes these buildings will

159
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,310
flood

160
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,610
and when they flooded how will people
still use them

161
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,560
and I think words can actually get much
tougher is some other these more

162
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,540
more vulnerable areas are gonna flood
and then fled again and again and again

163
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,010
and it it is really all that the eastern
seaboard you can see

164
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,290
and I think it's going to get tougher
and tougher for us to be able to

165
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,660
societies day it's okay you know

166
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,580
have this many people get injured lose
their lives there's gonna be some way in

167
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,020
which

168
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,260
in these neighborhoods a really good to
reformulate

169
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,200
well

170
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,400
the Laura I is rising temperatures

171
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,520
at the global issue certainly by

172
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,980
when it happens in experience for you
what happens at a very local level so it

173
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,930
intersects with

174
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,700
vulnerabilities that already exist
locally people who are the most

175
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,900
vulnerable

176
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,540
in a particular neighborhood or city an
everyday level

177
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,940
they're going to have the hardest time
coping with the effects of this as well

178
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,910
as adopting

179
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,550
to climate change and I think there's
also urged going to look at it really

180
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,440
individually to look at a house by house
and think okay

181
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,300
you know this house you wanna buy out
yes or no but is a relief social

182
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,390
decisions you know things like after
after sandy there's a lot of talk lately

183
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,840
how do we protect lower Manhattan

184
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,270
because it has such a high concentration
of economic activity there so much well

185
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,150
and so you know lower Manhattan probably
won't have to do a measure tree

186
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,660
me there's going to be a lot of public
and private investment that prioritizes

187
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,710
protecting the appli- and so

188
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,030
the very political decision the end of
the day which places get protected which

189
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,790
places

190
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,570
have to move which places do residents
get a move on their own terms

191
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,120
which places people just gradually go
into foreclosure have to leave

192
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,690
you know who has the resources start
over again somewhere else who's given

193
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,900
assistance do that and who isn't

194
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,920
all those questions really are our
social

195
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,930
and political questions

196
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,220
Mike to move here

197
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,240
army to listen to require

198
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,440
and at night when it was very by hear
the waves

199
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,880
Berkshire it was really a common
affliction

200
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,120
fitness area are common

201
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,180
I could also tell when it was gonna rain
causes getaway splash in the ruling was

202
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,320
coming on its war

203
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,380
whatever the wave solder

204
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:17,850
rations
